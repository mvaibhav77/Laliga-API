# Laliga-API

It is a small API Web Application showing basic information about La Liga League of Europe..
I used :
1. Bootswatch for styling
2. Fetch API to get the data from https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-football-beta/.
3. Node.js for creating local server with Axios.

Link for the real Application: https://vaibhav-laliga-app.herokuapp.com/

I am not very good at node.js right now I only used it to hide my API keys.
Soon I will be learning Node.js properly. 

Thankyou...
